# Customer Segmentation

Abstract: 

In this project, we analyzed and segmented the customers of an e-commerce company by using the RFM approach. This will enable the e-commerce company to optimize their retention and acquisition strategies.

Market Outlook: 

E-commerce stores which became success stories were successful in targeting the desired customers. One of the techniques by which they were able to achieve this was customer segmentation i.e. by segmenting the existing customers based on frequency of purchases, monetary value etc. E-commerce stores who designed market strategies based on mass marketing soon realized the need of customer segmentation as an alternative to save cost and efforts in the digital sphere. In a real-world segmentation scenario, there might be hundreds of variables which can be used but broadly they segment the customers by the following characteristics:

- Geographic - Segments based on country, state, and city.
- Demographic - Segments based on gender, age, income, education level, etc.
  
- Psychographic - Segments based on geography, lifestyle, age and religious beliefs, etc.
- Behavior - Segments based on consumer personality traits, attitudes, and lifestyles
  



## Overview of the Problem

You have been provided with a single file which contains data related to the e- commerce transactions. This data contains the date-time of sale, customer shipping location, and price of single unit from 2016 to 2017.

For this project, we have built an unsupervised learning model using KNN and DBSCAN to analyse and segment the customers on basis of R, F and M.

Post my data science certification with Imarticus Learning, this is a real-life, live project we got to work on with a Senior Data Scientist, Mr. Prashant Sharma from KPMG. We spent a month working on this project along with the associated marketing strategies.
